                        <p class="card-text">Our program is designed to bring together employees who may want to swop deployment stations within the same organization. The whole concept developed from first-hand experience by the programmers in trying to get possible candidates for swoping of teaching places for their spouses. The frustration of hopping from one ineffective way of searching to another gave birth to this program.
                        We now say goodbye to hunting for possible matches on social media platforms and messing the walls of Education Offices with adverts!! Our database and engine is just designed for that!</p>
